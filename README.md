## Description

This module manages the [BIND](https://www.isc.org/bind/) DNS server and associated [DNS
zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_zone).

## Setup

### What bind affects

- the BIND package, service, and configuration files

If configured to install the backported package, also affects
[APT](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/apt) sources by ensuring that backports are available.

### Setup requirements

See [`metadata.json`](metadata.json) for supported operating systems, supported Puppet versions,
and Puppet module dependencies.

### Beginning with bind

```puppet
include bind
```

## Usage

This module is designed to use the [default Debian `bind9` package
configuration](https://salsa.debian.org/dns-team/bind9/-/tree/debian/main/debian/extras/etc) as a
basis.

- [Reference](REFERENCE.md)

For parameter defaults, see the [`data`](data) directory, which is organized according to
[`hiera.yaml`](hiera.yaml).

## Limitations

See [`metadata.json`](metadata.json) for supported operating systems, supported Puppet versions,
and Puppet module dependencies.

Downgrading the package by setting `package_backport => false` (after it had been `true`) is not
supported by this module, but you can of course do this downgrade manually.

## Development

### Running tests

```console
pdk validate --parallel \
&& pdk test unit --parallel \
&& pdk bundle exec rake litmus:tear_down \
