## Description

This module manages the BIND DNS server and associated DNS zones.

## Setup

### What bind affects

- the BIND package, service, and configuration files

If configured to install the backported package, also affects APT sources by ensuring that
backports are available.

### Setup requirements

See [metadata.json](metadata.json) for Puppet module dependencies.

### Beginning with bind

```puppet
include bind
```

## Usage

Include usage examples for common use cases in the **Usage** section. Show your
users how to use your module to solve problems, and be sure to include code
examples. Include three to five examples of the most important or common tasks a
user can accomplish with your module. Show users how to accomplish more complex
tasks that involve different types, classes, and functions working in tandem.

## Limitations

Downgrading the package by setting `package_backport => false` (after it had been `true`) is not
supported by this module, but you can of course do this downgrade manually.

## Development

### Running tests

```console
pdk validate --parallel \
&& pdk test unit --parallel \
&& pdk bundle exec rake litmus:tear_down \
&& pdk bundle exec rake 'litmus:provision_list[default]' \
&& pdk bundle exec rake litmus:install_agent \
&& pdk bundle exec rake litmus:install_module \
&& pdk bundle exec rake litmus:acceptance:parallel \
&& pdk bundle exec rake litmus:tear_down
