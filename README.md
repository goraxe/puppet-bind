## Description

This module manages the [BIND](https://www.isc.org/bind/) DNS server and associated [DNS
zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_zone).

## Setup

### What bind affects

- the BIND package, service, and configuration files
- a [resolvconf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvconf) package, by default
  [openresolv](https://roy.marples.name/projects/openresolv/), is installed if
  `resolvconf_service_enable` is `true`. This causes the localhost's BIND to be used in
  `/etc/resolv.conf`.

If configured to install the backported package, also affects
[APT](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/apt) sources by ensuring that backports are available.

### Setup requirements

See [`metadata.json`](metadata.json) for supported operating systems, supported Puppet versions,
and Puppet module dependencies.

### Beginning with bind

For a default configuration that provides recursive name resolution service:

```puppet
include bind
```

## Usage

See the [reference](REFERENCE.md) for available class parameters.

For parameter defaults, see the [`data`](data) directory, which is organized according to
[`hiera.yaml`](hiera.yaml).

The test suite in the [`spec`](spec) directory is a good source for usage examples.

## Limitations

See [`metadata.json`](metadata.json) for supported operating systems, supported Puppet versions,
and Puppet module dependencies.

Downgrading the package by setting `package_backport => false` (after it had been `true`) is not
supported by this module, but you can of course do this downgrade manually.

## Development

### Running tests

[PDK](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/pdk_install.html) and
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) must be installed and working.
[GNU Parallel](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/parallel) is used to run acceptance tests in
parallel by default. This can be disabled with the `--no-parallel` option.

```console
./run_tests
```

### Generating documentation

```console
pdk bundle exec rake strings:generate:reference
```
