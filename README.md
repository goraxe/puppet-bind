## Description

This module manages the [BIND](https://www.isc.org/bind/) DNS server and associated [DNS
zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_zone).

## Setup

### What bind affects

- the BIND package, service, configuration, and zone files
- a [resolvconf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvconf) package, by default
  [openresolv](https://roy.marples.name/projects/openresolv/), is installed if
  `resolvconf_service_enable` is `true`. This causes the localhost's BIND to be used in
  `/etc/resolv.conf`.
- if configured to install the backported package, also affects
  [APT](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/apt) sources by ensuring that backports are available.

### Setup requirements

See [`metadata.json`](metadata.json) for supported operating systems, supported Puppet versions,
and Puppet module dependencies.

### Beginning with bind

For a default configuration that provides recursive, caching name resolution service:

```puppet
include bind
```

On Debian, install the `bind9` package from the backports repository (ensures that the
`$facts['os']['distro']['codename']-backports` apt source is configured using the
[`puppetlabs-apt`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt) module, but will fail if a
backported package does not exist for your particular
`$facts['os']['distro']['codename']-backports` repo; check on the [Debian package
tracker](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/bind9)):

```puppet
class { 'bind':
  package_backport => true,
}
```

## Usage

See the [reference](REFERENCE.md) for available class parameters.

For parameter defaults, see the [`data`](data) directory, which is organized according to
[`hiera.yaml`](hiera.yaml).

The test suite in the [`spec`](spec) directory is a good source for usage examples.

To manage the resource records of a zone with this module, the zone must be dynamically updatable
by the host being managed, via either the `allow-update` or `update-policy` configuration
options.

### Recursive, caching only

Using a minimal configuration with BIND defaults:

```puppet
include bind
```

TODO: provide more examples.

### Authoritative only

When creating a new zone with BIND, the zone file must have a `$TTL`, a SOA record, an NS record,
and an address record for that host used in the NS record. All of these have defaults (see the
`zone_default_*` parameters of [`init.pp`](manifests/init.pp) and the [initial zone
template](templates/db.empty.epp)) so you don't have to specify them. The default initial zone
creates `A` and `AAAA` records based on the host's facts. Those default NS records are only used
if no NS records are provided for the zone's origin. You should specify your own SOA and NS
records unless you happen to want those defaults. Note that if you want to provide your own NS
records at the zone origin, you also have to provide your own SOA record.

TODO: provide examples.

### Authoritative and caching

TODO: provide examples.

## Limitations

See [`metadata.json`](metadata.json) for supported operating systems, supported Puppet versions,
and Puppet module dependencies.

Downgrading the package by setting `package_backport => false` (after it had been `true`) is not
supported by this module, but you can of course do such a downgrade manually outside of Puppet.

Changing the value provided for a zone's `$TTL` directive after initial zone creation is not
supported by this module (because the zone file is only created initially from a template and
then never replaced, only updated dynamically using the [RFC
2136](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2136) method), but you can do this manually outside of
Puppet.

## Development

The development of this module attempts to be
[test-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) as much as possible.
Therefore, changes should generally be accompanied by tests. The test suite is located in the
[`spec`](spec) directory. Acceptance tests (in the [`acceptance`](spec/acceptance) directory) use
[Serverspec](https://serverspec.org/), while unit tests (everything else) use
[rspec-puppet](https://rspec-puppet.com/).

### Running tests

[PDK](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/pdk_install.html) and
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) must be installed and working.
[GNU Parallel](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/parallel) is used to run acceptance tests in
parallel by default. This can be disabled with the `--no-parallel` option.

```console
./run_tests
```

### Generating documentation

```console
pdk bundle exec rake strings:generate:reference
```
